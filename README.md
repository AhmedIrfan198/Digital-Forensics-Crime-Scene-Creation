# Digital Forensics Crime Scene Creation

## Objective
The Digital Forensics Crime Scene Creation project aimed to simulate a real-world digital crime scenario to enhance investigative skills in digital forensics. This project focused on creating a comprehensive case study involving the identification, analysis, and documentation of digital evidence. It demonstrates proficiency in forensic tools and techniques, as well as the ability to apply legal and procedural standards in a forensic investigation.

## Skills Learned
- Proficiency in using digital forensics tools (Autopsy, VeraCrypt, FTKimager, Steganography, CCleaner, HashMyFiles, BulkFileChanger, Encase)
- Advanced understanding of digital evidence handling and analysis
- Ability to create detailed forensic reports and document findings
- Knowledge of legal standards and legislation related to digital crimes (Protection from Harassment Act 1997, Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015)
- Enhanced skills in identifying and interpreting various types of digital artefacts
- Application of forensic methodologies in a simulated environment
- Improved critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a forensic context

## Tools Used
- Autopsy for digital forensics investigations and data recovery
- VeraCrypt for disk encryption and analysis of encrypted files
- FTKimager for creating forensic images of digital media
- Steganography tools for detecting hidden data within images
- CCleaner for data wiping and system cleaning analysis
- HashMyFiles for generating and comparing file hashes
- BulkFileChanger for modifying file attributes
- Encase for comprehensive digital investigations and evidence collection

## Steps
### Step 1: Initial Incident Report and Evidence Collection
**Skills Gained**: Incident response, evidence handling, chain of custody documentation  
**Outcome**: Responded to a privacy invasion report, collected digital evidence (USB drive) from the suspect's residence.

### Step 2: Legislation Analysis
**Skills Gained**: Understanding of relevant laws and legal standards, application of legislation in digital forensics  
**Outcome**: Analyzed applicable laws (Protection from Harassment Act 1997, Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015) to understand the legal context of the case.

### Step 3: Digital Evidence Analysis
**Skills Gained**: Forensic imaging, data recovery, artefact analysis  
**Outcome**: Created forensic images of the USB drive, recovered and analyzed digital artefacts, identified evidence of harassment and unauthorized distribution of private images.

### Step 4: Artefact Examination and Documentation
**Skills Gained**: Detailed examination of digital artefacts, documentation of findings  
**Outcome**: Documented findings of various artefacts (images, videos, hidden files) related to the case, created a timeline of activities based on artefact analysis.

### Step 5: Reporting and Presentation
**Skills Gained**: Forensic report writing, presentation of findings  
**Outcome**: Compiled a comprehensive forensic report detailing the investigation process, findings, and legal implications, presented the case study.

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in simulating a digital crime scene and conducting a thorough forensic investigation. By utilizing various forensic tools and adhering to legal standards, I demonstrated my ability to handle and analyze digital evidence effectively. The skills and knowledge gained through this project are crucial for real-world digital forensics investigations, making it a valuable addition to my professional portfolio.
